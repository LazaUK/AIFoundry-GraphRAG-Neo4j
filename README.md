# Northwind: Graph RAG with Neo4, Azure AI Foundry and Langchain

This repo demonstrates how to deploy a **Neo4j** graph database pre-loaded with the _Northwind_ dataset and use it as a knowledge base for Graph RAG workflows.

The solution includes a containerised **Neo4j** backend and a **Streamlit** frontend powered by **Azure AI Foundry** and **Langchain**.

> [!INFORMATION]
> This project utilises the _Northwind_ dataset, kindly shared by Martin O'Hanlon and the Neo4j team on this [repository](https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/northwind). All CSV data files used in the graph import are derived directly from this original work.
